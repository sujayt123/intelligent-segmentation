# Intelligent Image segmentation

(A work in progress. Please excuse the lack of proper testing and current project structure; those will be resolved shortly)

### Context
I found a [nifty article](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse576/03sp/readings/mort-sigg95.pdf
) about intelligent image segmentation while browsing the web for something fun to do with vision. Additional information is available [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/09wi/Lects/lect4.pdf).
